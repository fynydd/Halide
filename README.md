# Halide

Halide is a set of tools that provide ASP.NET and MVC developers with additional high-level functionality for their web application projects, including extension methods for base types (like strings, array, numerics), and static helpers for encryption, compression, REST calls, SCSS compilation, CSS and JavaScript minification, and much more. Halide requires no commercial third party components.
